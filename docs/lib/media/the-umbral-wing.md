# The High Tide University

Located within [[Alduriel]] in [[The Oustovern Islands|The Dragon Islands]] (northwest of the Naburian empire), the High Tide University provides high education to those who seek it and to descendants of the wealthy people of the Empire.

One of the few places that teach magic, history, and other subjects of the world. Noble families from the central Mysthia, usually send their best descendants to learn here.

Even though it was once a place where capable people learned the ways of the world, slowly it became a placeholder for noble firstborns with thoughts of greatness.

## The Umbral Wing

> _With the knowledge under their wing one is as powerful as a dragon._

Slowly drifting apart from the university, The Umbral Wing refers to the Arcanum of the University. A place to learn and research aspects of magic. Although it is also affected by high tuition and the snob plague, the Umbral Wing has its own way of working.

The council behaves as a gatekeeping for people not actually interested in magic interviewing each student individually. They are forced to accept all the students who pay tuition, however, each candidate is individually interviewed. If the council doesn't trust them, they will only have access to basic research and spells.

## The ascension

Every five years, a challenge is made, available to all those who were once students, granting a position within the Umbral wing either as a council member, a teacher, or a researcher under the title of Arch Mage. This challenge is called The Ascension.

When participating in this challenge, advanced concepts of magic must be proven through several tasks and only the one who excels in those concepts will be granted a place within the Umbral wing.

## The elven ruling

In the later years, mainly elven people and long-lived species earned access to the Umbral wing's gatekeeping council. These members are reluctant to give access to advanced concepts and knowledge of magic to those who haven't studied for at least a century-long, which they consider a fair amount of time.

Although this sounds like insanity, they only teach the advanced concepts to those of their kin who have been there for that time. This gives the rest of the attendants a less-than-fair approach to studying magic with minimal resources.
